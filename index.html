    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a second-year Ph.D. student in Transportation Engineering at the University of Florida, where I am also pursuing a Ph.D. minor in Urban and Regional Planning. I completed both my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Transportation Engineering from Pulchowk Campus, Tribhuvan University, Nepal. My doctoral research is currently being supervised by Dr. Sivaramakrishnan Srinivasan.
    </p>
    <p>
      My research is centered on improving transportation safety and planning through data-driven methodologies. Specifically, I focus on:
      <br>a) Identifying and understanding the causal factors behind various types of traffic crashes;
      <br>b) Developing and applying statistical and machine learning models to examine the spatial and temporal dynamics of crash occurrences;
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to crash analysis, my broader interests include big data analytics, safety performance modeling, travel behavior analysis, and transportation planning. I frequently work with discrete choice models and other statistical as well as Machine Learning techniques to examine behavioral responses and guide data-driven decision-making in transportation systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my free time, I like to read books (fiction and non-fiction both), play chess and watch football.
